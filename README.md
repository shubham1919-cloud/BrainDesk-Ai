BrainDesk AI

BrainDesk is an advanced full-screen desktop AI assistant built for immersive, intelligent interaction. Inspired by cinematic visuals and powered by real-time voice and text commands, BrainDesk combines aesthetics with utility—functioning as a virtual desk, a visual assistant, and a personal task manager. Designed and developed solo by Shubham.

Features

1. Immersive Interface

Interstellar-inspired Globe: A stunning 3D globe with glowing blue rotating rings appears at launch, reminiscent of Interstellar's black hole—designed to create a visually cinematic experience.

Ambient River Background: The chat window overlays a looped river video for a calming atmosphere that enhances user focus and clarity.


2. Multi-Modal Interaction

Live Voice Interaction: A mic button at the bottom center allows real-time conversations with the AI.

Text Input: A search bar with an accessible mic icon for typed queries, ensuring inclusivity for all user preferences.


3. Persistent AI Memory

ChatLog System: BrainDesk stores every conversation and memory in ChatLog.json, allowing contextual continuity across sessions.

Adaptive Personality: Learns and evolves with user behavior, retaining custom preferences unless history is cleared.


4. Intelligent Voice Engine

Speech-to-Text Module: Utilizes a custom voice.html powered by inbuilt JavaScript and Selenium Chrome WebDriver for lightning-fast and offline-capable voice recognition.


5. Integrated App Launcher

App Recognition Engine: On first launch, app_name.json and app_name_temp.json are auto-generated to log installed app names, locations, and API triggers for instant launching via text or voice.


6. Real-Time State Management

Status Tracking: A Status.data file reflects the AI’s current activity: Available, Listening, Answering, or Searching.

Mic Tracker: Mic.data manages the mic status, ensuring responsive listening and visual cues.


7. Internal Communication System

Background Process Handler: Database.data handles all internal messages and backend tasks before responding, including system actions like “History cleared.”

AI Response Archive: Responses.data stores all generated responses for future optimization and analysis.


8. Creative Tools

Image Generator: When prompted (e.g., "Generate an image of an apple"), Image generation.data logs the task and updates its status after image generation completes.


9. Modular and Auto-Healing

Auto-Regeneration: If key files (like voice.html, ChatLog.json) are missing or deleted, BrainDesk recreates them automatically to ensure stability.
